# How to contribute

This project is open to help from the community, especially those that are new to Git, GitHub, Git flow, making PRs, working on open source projects and the like.

There is no 'one way' to help out. You don't even have to know how to code in order to contribute--you can offer up design suggestions and mock ups too.

Follow the steps below to ensure you are not duplicating something already brought up or worked on.

1. Read the [README] (https://github.com/tristandenyer/brewery-search#brewery-search "README") first, to get an understanding of the project.
2. Check out the [project demo] (https://tristandenyer.github.io/brewery-search/ "project demo") and do a couple brewery searches.
3. If you are recommending a new feature or improvement (not a bug) [check to see if there are any issues](https://github.com/tristandenyer/brewery-search/issues "check to see if there are any issues") already mentioning it.
4. If you are reporting a bug, feel free to read the [open an issue](https://github.com/tristandenyer/brewery-search/issues "open an issue").
